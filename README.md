# py_topping, a topping on some already great libraries
## I create this library to make my team's projects easier and have VCS
<br>To Install a Stable Version
```python
pip install py-topping
```
<br>To Install a Newest Version
```python
pip install git+https://github.com/chanon-kr/Shared_Function.git
```
<br>
You could see samples of how to use this library inside the samples folder in github<br>
(https://github.com/chanon-kr/Shared_Function)
<br><br>
By the way, I'm not provide required libraries for you because of the topping concept,<br> 
I don't think it's a good idea to install every libraries to everyone.
